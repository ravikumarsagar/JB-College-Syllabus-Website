<p>
Boolean algebra and Logic gates, Combinational logic blocks(Adders, Multiplexers, Encoders, de-coder), Sequential logic
blocks(Latches, Flip-Flops, Registers, Counters) Store program control concept, Flynn’s classification of computers (SISD,
MISD, MIMD); Multilevel viewpoint of a machine: digital logic, micro architecture, ISA, operating systems, high level
language; structured organization; CPU, caches, main memory, secondary memory units & I/O; Performance metrics; MIPS,
MFLOPS
</p>

<p>
<b>Instruction Set Architecture:</b>
 Instruction set based classification of processors (RISC, CISC, and their comparison); addressing modes: register, immediate,
direct, indirect, indexed; Operations in the instruction set; Arithmetic and Logical, Data Transfer, Control Flow; Instruction set
formats (fixed, variable, hybrid); Language of the machine: 8086 ; simulation using MSAM.

<p>
<b>Basic non pipelined CPU Architecture and Memory Hierarchy & I/O Techniques</b>
CPU Architecture types (accumulator, register, stack, memory/ register) detailed data path of a typical register based CPU, FetchDecode-Execute
cycle (typically 3 to 5 stage); microinstruction sequencing, implementation of control unit, Enhancing
performance with pipelining.
The need for a memory hierarchy (Locality of reference principle, Memory hierarchy in practice: Cache, main memory and
secondary memory, Memory parameters: access/ cycle time, cost per bit); Main memory (Semiconductor RAM & ROM
organization, memory expansion, Static & dynamic memory types); Cache memory (Associative & direct mapped cache
organizations.

	<b>Introduction to Parallelism and Computer Organization [80x86]:</b>
 Goals of parallelism (Exploitation of concurrency, throughput enhancement); Amdahl’s law; Instruction level parallelism
(pipelining, super scaling –basic features); Processor level parallelism (Multiprocessor systems overview).
Instruction codes, computer register, computer instructions, timing and control, instruction cycle, type of instructions, memory
reference, register reference. I/O reference, Basics of Logic Design, accumulator logic, Control memory, address sequencing,
